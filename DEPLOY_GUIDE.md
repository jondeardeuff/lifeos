# 🚀 LifeOS Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Railway (Manual Process)

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign in
2. **Create New Project**: Click "New Project" 
3. **Deploy from GitHub**: 
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Or use "Deploy from GitHub repo" and enter the repo URL
4. **Configure Build**: Railway will automatically detect Node.js and use the Dockerfile

### 2. Environment Variables to Set in Railway

In your Railway project dashboard, go to **Variables** and add:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

### 3. Alternative: Deploy Using CLI (Terminal Required)

If you have terminal access:

```bash
# In the project directory
cd "/Users/jondeardeuff/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jon@themillut.com/My Drive/APPS/Management App/WORKSPACE/lifeos"

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN="*"
```
