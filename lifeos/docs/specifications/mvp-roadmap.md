## Development Principles

### MVP First
- Start with minimal feature set
- Get user feedback early
- Iterate based on usage
- Don't over-engineer

### Progressive Enhancement
```typescript
// Start simple
const createTask = (title: string) => ({ title });

// Enhance gradually
const createTask = (input: {
  title: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  projectId?: string;
  // Add more as needed
}) => ({ ...input });
```

### Feature Flags
```typescript
const features = {
  voiceCommands: true,
  bankingIntegration: isPhase3Complete(),
  aiSuggestions: isPhase5Complete(),
  widgets: isPhase6Complete(),
};
```

### Testing Strategy
- Phase 1: Manual testing + basic unit tests
- Phase 2: Add integration tests
- Phase 3: Add E2E tests
- Phase 4: Add mobile testing
- Phase 5: Add performance tests
- Phase 6: Full test automation

## Release Strategy

### Beta Program
- Phase 1: Internal team only
- Phase 2: 10 beta users
- Phase 3: 100 beta users
- Phase 4: 1,000 beta users
- Phase 5: Public beta
- Phase 6: General availability

### Pricing Tiers (Phase 6)
```yaml
tiers:
  free:
    tasks: 100/month
    projects: 3
    team: 1
    price: $0
    
  personal:
    tasks: unlimited
    projects: 10
    team: 1
    banking: true
    price: $9/month
    
  professional:
    tasks: unlimited
    projects: unlimited
    team: 5
    banking: true
    ai: true
    price: $29/month
    
  business:
